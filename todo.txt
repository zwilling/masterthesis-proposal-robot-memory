Evaluation:


RCLL sync: network throughput, robustness package loss
RCLL trigger
Complex tiggers: @home (e.g. dishwasher full) find expressiveness limit (vs runtime)
Computables runtime measurements
query computation time vs query expressiveness
  simple: where is the storage place for the red cup
  medium: which objects are not at their storage position (cross product/conjunction DB term)
memory usage
database size

(Blocks world: remember block positions after put)
