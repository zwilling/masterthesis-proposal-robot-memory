\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}
This chapter presents the evaluation results of the thesis. After some
remarks about the evaluation context in \refsec{sec:eval-context}, we
analyze the durations of different robot memory operations in
\refsec{sec:op-durations}. This includes comparing the durations for
different expressiveness levels and database sizes to find a
compromise between expressiveness and performance. Furthermore, we
analyze the overhead of database operations introduced by robot memory
features. In \refsec{sec:performance} we present the performance of
the system in both introduced application scenarios. This includes CPU
and memory usage, network throughput, and statistics about robot
memory operations. Qualitatively, \refsec{sec:qualitative} evaluates
how well the robot memory fulfills the goals defined in the approach.

\section{Evaluation context}
\label{sec:eval-context}
The benchmarks presented in this chapter were performed on Fedora 23
systems with 16 GB RAM and an Intel Core i7-3770 with four hyper-threading enabled cores at
$3.4$~GHz. For local benchmarks, everything, including Fawkes, MongoDB,
the Gazebo simulation and ROS, ran on a single system. For distributed
benchmarks, three identical systems were used. Each system hosted its
own Fawkes, ROS, and MongoDB processes and one system additionally,
hosts the Gazebo simulation.

Since the robot memory runs inside the Fawkes framework and thus
inside the Fawkes process, the performance of the robot memory is
influenced by Fawkes and can not directly be measured separately. The
influences are caused by other components, such as localization,
reasoning, and collision avoidance, and by the thread management of
Fawkes. To softly guarantee loop times for other threads, Fawkes
suspends threads with a too long loop iteration. When measuring
durations of robot memory operations, this can increase large
measurement values because if an operation takes longer than the
allowed loop iteration time, the time being suspended is added to the
measurement.

\section{Robot Memory Operations}
\label{sec:op-durations}
In this section, we analyze the run-time durations of robot memory
operations, such as insert, query, and update. We also analyze how
these change with computables and triggers. The goal is to find out
how fast the robot memory works. Besides the influence of the
implementation, the durations heavily depend on the underlying
complexity (e.g. of a query) and \emph{domain size}, which is the
amount of information stored in the robot memory. Here, we want to
find out how the durations scale with increasing domain size and
increasing complexity.

The structure of the data used for this evaluation is chosen in a way
to be similar to information that is usually stored in a robot
memory. Furthermore, it should simplify the analysis. The used data mimics
a robot's knowledge about object and their positions to solve a tidy
up scenario. For each object, the robot memory contains a document
with the object's name, current position, and the storage position it
belongs to. Names are unique and storage positions are randomly chosen
out of $1000$ possibilities. Objects are at a random misplaced position with
probability $0.01$ and at their proper storage position otherwise. The
object's name is a string to enforce string comparisons, which are
expected to be often needed in a real scenario. For evaluation
reasons, we do not index the collection by the object names right now
because this heavily impacts the duration. An evaluation plugin in
Fawkes generates the data and calls random operations. To analyze how
the durations scale with the domain size, the plugin calls the
operations repeatedly after increasing the domain size from $0$ to
$100000$ documents by steps of $1000$ documents.

The analysis is separated into the main classes of operations, namely
insertions in \refsec{sec:insertions}, queries in
\refsec{sec:queries}, and updates in \refsec{sec:updates}. Because
deletions behave very similar to updates, both search for documents
and work with them, they are also covered in the section about
updates. \refsec{sec:eval-computables} covers and explains the impact
of computables on query durations and \refsec{sec:eval-trigger} deals
with the impact of event triggers. Operations that are performed
rarely are not analyzed. For example dropping or restoring a collection and
registration of triggers and computables are only performed once
during initialization.  In the course of implementing and evaluating
the application scenarios, their durations were not noticeable compared
to the initialization time of the whole robot software.

\subsection{Insertions}
\label{sec:insertions}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/insert-durations}
    \caption{Insertions}
    \label{fig:insert-durations}

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption[Duration of robot memory operations with increasing domain size]{Duration of robot memory operations with increasing domain size}
  \label{fig:eval-durations-1}
\end{figure}
The insertion of a new document into the robot memory is overall the
fastest operation.
\reffig{fig:insert-durations} shows the distribution of
insert durations with increasing domain size. It is noticeable that the
duration does not depend on the domain size and thus has run-time
complexity of $O(1)$. The insertion time is small with an average of
$0.125ms$. However, there are single outliers not present in
\reffig{fig:insert-durations}. These outliers occur periodically, when
MongoDB flushes database changes from the RAM to the hard drive. We
could reduce the occurrence frequency of these outliers to one in $60s$, which is the
default flushing frequency of MongoDB. To reach this, we had to
disable the forward logging of MongoDB, called Journaling. In this
evaluation scenario, the outliers took about $0.3s$ because of the
large amount of written documents and the threading in Fawkes.  The
overhead of the robot memory compared to the duration of the raw
MongoDB operation has an average of $0.006ms$, which is about $5.5\%$.
The overhead is caused by verifying the collection name, deciding if
the local or distributed database is used, adding meta-data, and
mutual exclusion of database usage. The robot memory overhead measured
here does not include checking if triggers were activated by inserting
the document. This is caused by the asynchronous and separate checking by
the trigger manager. The size and the complexity of inserted
documents did not make a noticeable difference.\todo{need to add
  numbers?}

\subsection{Queries}
\label{sec:queries}
Queries are more complex operations than insertions and also take more
time. \reffig{fig:query-durations} shows that query durations heavily
depend on many factors, such as domain-size and query complexity. The
query durations, when searching for an object by its unique name,
linearly depend on the domain size. The other plot shows the query
durations for finding objects that are not at their storage location
and thus would have to be tidied up. The query is more complex
because it contains a comparison between two values that is formulated
in JavaScript. From $0$ to about $10000$ documents, also a linear
increase can be seen. With more documents the average duration does
not increase, because of a query evaluation trick of MongoDB. MongoDB
lazily evaluates queries and returns a cursor to the first batch of
documents that match the query. While the user iteratively fetches
documents from the cursor, MongoDB continues the query evaluation if
the batch was emptied. For the \texttt{'find object name'} query, the whole
database was searched because the unique object could not fill the
batch. However it is possible to request a smaller batch (e.g. only
one) document for faster computation.  \todo[inline]{comparison with
  indexing} The overhead of the robot memory query operation does not
depend on the domain size and has an average duration of $0.6ms$. The
largest part of that overhead is caused by the computable manager,
even if in this scenario no computables are registered. The computable
manager performs a single insert and remove on a separate collection
to prepare checking if the query matches a computable and to clean up
afterwards. Because of this insertion, the duration spikes observed
for insertions can also occur for queries. As \reffig{fig:query-durations}
shows, the query duration heavily depends on the complexity of the
query. Especially the expressive JavaScript functions are expensive
compared to the MongoDB internal query language without JavaScript. By
formulating queries smartly, complex questions can often be
efficient in practice. For example, checking whether the dishwasher
is full sounds like a question that is computationally costly because
it requires a JavaScript function. But it can be formulated efficiently
by first filtering only the objects in the dishwasher with a fast
JavaScript-free query and then summing up the objects volume to check
if it exceeds a given threshold. This way the costly sum computation,
which can be done by aggregation or JavaScript, only needs to be
computed for the few objects in the dishwasher.

\subsection{Updates and Deletions}
\label{sec:updates}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/update-durations}
    \caption{Updates}
    \label{fig:update-durations}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption[Duration of robot memory operations with increasing domain size]{Duration of robot memory operations with increasing domain size}
  \label{fig:eval-durations-2}
\end{figure}
Updates consist of a query defining what should be updated and some
key-value pairs, which should be changed. Thus the duration of an
update should be similar to a query plus an
insertion. \reffig{fig:update-durations} shows the duration of
position updates of objects with a random name. Because the used
update operation only updates a single document, the durations are
roughly uniformly distributed with an upper bound matching the
duration of \texttt{'find object'} queries in
\reffig{fig:query-durations}. Thus the duration of update operations
also scale linearly with the domain size. Duration of queries
searching for only one document also behave as in
\reffig{fig:update-durations}.  Because delete operations also consist
of a query and a fast change operation, they behave similar to
updates. The difference is that by default deletions are executed on
all documents and updates only on a single one. For both deletions and
updates, the overhead does not depend on the database size. Both
updates and deletions have an average overhead duration below
$0.02ms$. In contrast to to query operations, the computable manager
is not involved, because computed documents should not be updated and
they do not need to be removed manually.

\subsection{Computables}
\label{sec:eval-computables}
Computables generate new information when it is demanded by a
query. Thus each new query is checked by the computable manager as
explained in \refsec{sec:queries}. \reffig{fig:computable-durations}
shows the time needed for checking if a query demands a computable and
for computing the results. The computable used in
\reffig{fig:computable-durations} calculates the distance of the robot
to the closest object in the database and yields the object's name,
position, and distance. The measurement does not include the query
duration of finding the computed document. The computation time of
the computable itself scales linear with the domain size because each
object's distance needs to be checked. The time of the overhead does
not depend on the domain size. The overhead includes inserting the
original query in MongoDB, evaluating the demand query for each
registered computable to check if the original query demands the
computable, and a clean up operation. Furthermore, the results of the
computable need to be inserted into the robot memory. Asynchronously
in the main loop of the robot memory, computed documents are removed
again. Thus the time needed for computables depends on the amount of
registered computables, the amount of computed documents, and mainly
the computation time needed for each matching computable itself. This
computation time can get large if the computable solves problems with
higher complexity. For example a computable that finds the pair of
objects with the smallest distance to each other would scale
quadratically with the domain size. To avoid repeated computation of
the same data, we implemented caching for computables. As long as
specified by the caching time, the computation step is skipped if the
new query is identical to the query that demanded the computation
before. The remaining overhead of the computable manager is the same.

\subsection{Trigger}
\label{sec:eval-trigger}
Triggers notify an application when something in the database changes
as specified in the trigger query. For this benchmark, we registered a
trigger on new objects in a certain location (e.g. in the laundry
box). Whether a trigger event happened, is checked each loop iteration of
the robot memory by the trigger manager. Because trigger queries,
which check for these events, are only executed on the Oplog and not
on the whole database, the time needed to check trigger depends on the
amount of registered trigger and the amount of database changes
(insertions, updates, and deletions). The current domain size has no
influence. During the insertion of the $100000$ objects, the trigger
manager checked for trigger events $2249$ times with an average
duration of $0.27ms$. That makes $0.006ms$ per insertion. This
duration also depends heavily on the formulation of the trigger query
(e.g. in the case of JavaScript usage). These measurements do not
include the computation time needed by the callback function of the
trigger. Because the callback function is executed directly, its
computation time influences the loop time of the robot memory and can
in the worst case block it.

\section{Performance in evaluation scenarios}
\label{sec:performance}
To evaluate the performance of the robot memory, we performed
benchmarks in multiple application scenarios. The measurements during
the experiments were stored and plotted
with the Round Robin Database Tool (RRD) as in~\cite{RoboDB}. The
first scenario is a simulated RoboCup Logistics League game, in which
the synchronization of the worldmodel between the robots was
implemented with the robot memory.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{1\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/rcll-local/cpu-mem}
    \label{fig:rcll-cpu-mem}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{1\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/rcll-local/operations}
    \label{fig:rcll-ops}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption[Benchmark during a locally simulated RCLL game]{Benchmark during a locally simulated RCLL game}
  \label{fig:rcll-benchmark}
\end{figure}
\reffig{fig:rcll-benchmark} shows the CPU and memory usage, as well as
the operations performed by MongoDB. For clarity only the CPU and
memory usage of one Fawkes instance of the three robots is
plotted. Both MongoDB processes, one for the robot local robot memory
and one for the distributed worldmodel, have a CPU usage below $1\%$
and a memory usage below $40MB$. This is not surprising because the
robot's world model that needs to be synchronized in the RCLL only has
a size of $60$ to $100$ documents with an average object size of $390$
bytes. It only grows slowly because most of the documents are updated
and there are few new documents for incoming orders and and work-pieces
in production. This is also shown by the MongoDB operation count shown
in \reffig{fig:rcll-benchmark}, which matches the operation count of
the robot memory. The values include the database operations of
all three robots. \reffig{fig:rcll-benchmark} shows that the mostly
used operation is the \emph{Getmore} operation, which checks for an
existing query cursor if there are more matching documents than in the
previous batch. This is caused by the computable manager because it
periodically checks the Oplog for new changes that have to be reported
to the CLIPS agent. Since the robot memory runs inside the Fawkes
process, its CPU and memory usage is included in the values of Fawkes
in \reffig{fig:rcll-benchmark}. The growing memory usage of Fawkes is
also present in benchmarks of the RCLL simulation without the robot
memory and the CPU curve looks similar. Thus the robot memory plugin
has no large impact on the performance in this scenario. \todo{mention
amcl,colli, reasoning because they cause most CPU usage of Fawkes?}
\todo[inline]{Also show RCLL graph without robot memory? (looks
  boringly similar, but might be satisfying for the reader to verify)}
The size of the database on the hard-drive is about $1097MB$ for the
distributed part and $1060MB$ for each local one. The size does not
change noticeably over time. $1GB$ of each database is occupied by the
Oplog, which has a constant size because it is a capped collection.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/rsnetwork}
  \caption[Network usage of distributed robot memory during an RCLL game]{Network usage of distributed robot memory during an RCLL game}
  \label{fig:rcll-network}
\end{figure}
\reffig{fig:rcll-network} shows the network usage of a Replica Set to
distribute the robot memory over the multi-robot system in the
RCLL. The measurements are provided by MongoDB's server statistics and
only consider the packages sent from the Primary to a
Secondary. MongoDB uses TCP for Replica Sets. The
network usage mostly stays below $1\frac{KB}{s}$ and rarely
reaches about $2\frac{KB}{s}$. The usage is roughly proportional to
the number of operations. For comparison, the previous CLIPS agent,
which implements the world model synchronization with Protobuf
messages, sends between $7\frac{KB}{s}$ and $9\frac{KB}{s}$ in about
12 UDP packages over broadcast. The previous CLIPS agent acting as
Master sends the whole world model to other robots once a second
because it does not know if previous UDP packages reached other robots
or if a robot was restarted and requires the whole world model again.
 What is interesting to notice in \reffig{fig:rcll-network} is that
the amount of registered operations is smaller than the amount of
insert, update, and delete operations in \reffig{fig:rcll-benchmark}. This
is due to updates by the CLIPS agent, that do not apply to any
document or change a value in document to its current value. This is
detected by MongoDB and not distributed over the Oplog, because the
operation did not change anything.
% second->primary updates not shown (difficult to measure, c++ dirver
% directly sends them to the primary)

The second scenario is the Blocks World with the Kinova Jaco arm. The
robot memory is included in the following processes: The overhead
vision detects tags on blocks and publishes their position on the
blackboard. A PDDL domain generation constructs a problem description
from symbolic information in the robot memory. A part of this
information is provided by computables for \texttt{on-table} and
\texttt{clear} predicates. There are also computables for the
transformation of block positions and accessing the blackboard. The
computables for predicates are provided by a perception plugin. This
plugin continuously writes the block positions into the robot memory
for demonstration purposes. This is not very efficient because
continuously updating block positions requires executing the
blackboard computable and transform computable very often. A
computable that only inserts block positions when necessary would be
more efficient.

\begin{figure}

\reffig{fig:blocks-benchmark} shows the CPU and memory usage as well as the
operation count in MongoDB during the execution of two plans with 8
and 12 actions.  \todo[inline]{explain two hills-two plan executions (amount of visible blocks?)}

The amount of update operations is constant because the block
positions and their visibility state are constantly updated. The large
amount of queries, insertions, and deletions is mainly caused by the
blackboard and transform computables, which are executed to update the
block positions. The blackboard computable inserts the interface
values into the robot memory and the transform computable queries
these values and inserts the transformed values. For each query that
needs to be checked by the computable manager, one insert and deletion
is performed as well as a query for each registered computable.  The
CPU usage of Fawkes and the CPU and memory usage of MongoDB are similar
to the results of the RCLL benchmark.

\section{Qualitative Evaluation}
\label{sec:qualitative}
In this section, we quantitatively evaluate the robot memory based on
the goals defined in \refsec{sec:goals}. We discuss how well the
features of the robot memory work based on the quantitative evaluation
and the experience using the robot memory in the RCLL and
blocks world application scenarios. Both scenarios were chosen in a
way that all important robot memory features are covered.

\subsection{Flexible Storage and Retrieval:}
As demonstrated in the RCLL and blocks world, the robot memory
properly works as storage for robot data, information,
and knowledge. Insert, query, modify, and remove functions work as
supposed and are quality controlled by unit-tests. The robot memory is flexible
enough to maintain various kinds of information, such as symbolic knowledge
about a world model in the RCLL, spatial information about block
positions in the blocks world, and temporal information about how long
cached information has to be kept. As shown in
\refsec{sec:op-durations}, robot memory operations are very fast for
simple operations and reasonably fast for complex queries.
From our experience in the application scenarios, complex
queries are rarely required and can often be made faster by
reformulation.  Because of JavaScript usage, aggregation, and
Map-Reduce, queries are very expressive, since JavaScript is Turing
complete. However due to the nature of document orientation, it is
inconvenient to join documents from different collections as it would
be done in relational databases. This problem rarely occurs because
the document structure allows
storing additional information (e.g. by utilizing sub-documents).
\todo[inline]{move document vs. relational?}
The storage and retrieval functions of the robot memory are available
to a variety of components via the C++ interface or the interface
providers for PDDL, CLIPS, and OpenRAVE.

\subsection{Memory Sharing Between Knowledge Based Systems:}
The robot memory allows memory sharing between multiple knowledge
based systems. In the RCLL, we share the world model between multiple
robots using the same CLIPS reasoning engine. In the blocks world
scenario, the memory is shared between different kinds of components,
namely a symbolic PDDL planner, the motion planner OpenRAVE, a CLIPS
executive, and a perception plugin. The robot memory ensures
consistency because it is a
central storage and KBS can keep their internal world model updated
with triggers. Multiple state estimations by
different systems are avoided.  As shown in both application
scenarios, the robot memory is well suited as basis for the
collaboration and combination of multiple KBS. Accessing a common
storage is more convenient than accessing each others working memory
(e.g. as it was done to monitor the CLIPS world model in the
web-interface of Fawkes).  Another advantage of memory sharing with the
robot memory is that different planners can easily be exchanged and
thus compared. In the RCLL, we provide the world model in the robot
memory and show how a planner and CLIPS as executive can work
together. This is also the foundation for future work with different
planning systems in the RCLL.

\subsection{Special Views for Different Components:} 
Special views on the robot memory are
primarily realized by the used queries. A query can
filter which part of the robot memory is shown to a component by
selecting a collection and filtering documents with the query language
of MongoDB. Queries can also be used to rename keys of key-value pairs
in returned documents. The robot memory does not directly rename keys
or values. Thus, if some planner uses another identifier for an object
than a reasoner, one of them has to implement the mapping, for example
by providing a computable. An example for such a mapping is
the transform computable, which provides positions in other coordinate
systems. Computables also simplify hybrid reasoning because they allow
symbolic KBS to view spatio-temporal information in a symbolic
way. For example, a computable in the blocks world provides
\texttt{on-table} predicates, which are derived from block positions.
In a distributed system, the robot memory focuses the view on the shared
and local memory of a robot and hides the local memory of other robots. 

\subsection{Computation on Demand:}
The robot memory provides computation on demand with computables. In
the application scenarios, computables are a useful tool to provide
functions of perception components to KBS, which only need to execute
a usual robot memory query. They are also useful for hybrid reasoning
because they can transform information in the robot memory to be
usable by different components, as described in the previous
subsection. \reffig{fig:computable-durations} shows that
computables are fast in the sense that the overhead is small and the
complete query time mainly depends on the computation time. Compared
to not computing on demand, computables are more efficient because
they are only evaluated when required and for required parameters.
A disadvantage we noticed when heavily using computables in the blocks
world scenario is that the data flow over computables is difficult to
track and thus to debug during the development. This is caused by the
volatility of computed documents in the robot memory and the
flexibility of document-orientation. Similar to programming
languages with dynamic typing, comparisons can unintendedly fail, for
example because of spelling mistakes in a key name or comparison
of the string \texttt{"1"} with the number one. Because queries
only return an empty result instead of throwing an error in such
cases, the developer has to search for the problem. We
simplify this search by providing a configurable logging mechanism of
executed queries, computables, and results.
A major advantage of computables is the added extensibility by
allowing any computation function to be interfaceable over the robot
memory. For example it is possible to compensate for not choosing a
common sense reasoner as basis for the robot memory by integrating it
with computables. KnowRob, for example, could be connected to the
robot memory by querying information from the robot memory, adding it
to its ontologies, and providing KnowRob queries via computables.

\subsection{Shared Memory for Multi-Robot Systems:} 
In a multi-robot system, the robot memory can be distributed and thus
allows information sharing. The content of the robot memory is
consistent over the whole system and robust against failures of single
robots. Because of the persistency, it is even robust against a restart
of all robots. As showed in \reffig{fig:rcll-network}, the network
usage is small and only depends on changes in the robot memory. In the
RCLL application scenario, the synchronization of the world model with
the robot memory is convenient. It frees the CLIPS agent from
implementing its own synchronization and provides more
features. Especially useful is the focus on sending only changes and
detecting when a full re-synchronization is necessary. Previously the
CLIPS agent sent the full world model once a second because it did not
know which changes other agents already received. The distributed
robot memory works well together with triggers to keep the world model
updated for all CLIPS agents.

\subsection{Spatio-Temporal Grounding:}
The robot memory allows spatio-temporal grounding of the information
stored in it. Due to the flexible structure and representation in documents
with various types, such as floats and dates, adding spatio-temporal
information is simple. For example, we use spatial positions
of objects in the blocks world and times for caching of computables.
The robot memory can also consider spatio-temporal information in
queries. Simple operations, such as comparison, can be expressed in
the query language and complex operation can be performed by
computables as, for example, shown by the transform computable.

\subsection{Triggers:}
By using triggers, components can be notified about changes
in the robot memory. This is especially useful for keeping a world
model in a KBS updated according to the robot memory. In the RCLL
application scenario, this works well and frees the agent from
implementing synchronization or pulling mechanisms to search for
changes. Another beneficial use case for triggers is message passing
(e.g. for passing a plan to an executive). This way of message passing
is simple. KBS can use the existing interface to the robot
memory and messages can be changed in the development with small
effort because documents have no fixed structure in contrast to
messages over the blackboard or Protobuf. To ensure a reasonable
computation time, triggers only analyze the changes caused by single
operations on the robot memory. We considered allowing triggers to
describe events of whole collections, such as the amount of objects
exceeding a threshold. We decided against it because this would
require periodically evaluating queries over whole collections and
could slow down the robot memory for large collections or complex
queries. Analyzing single changes in the robot memory suffices for
use cases, such as keeping a world model updated. 
More complex problems, such as monitoring the amount, can still be
implemented efficiently by creating a trigger for the insertion and
deletion of such objects and then checking the object count in the
callback function. Further triggers can not notify about documents
provided by computables without invoking the computable from the
application. This is due to the theoretical complexity of verifying if
an arbitrary function yields a specified result for any input
values. However triggers do work on the result of computables. Thus
the application has to specify when and with which query the computable
is invoked. Because of these two restrictions of triggers, they are
computationally fast as shown in \refsec{sec:eval-trigger}. They
work well in both application scenarios and are convenient for
components using the robot memory.

\subsection{Persistent Storage:}
The robot memory provides a persistent storage. The content of the
robot memory is stored on the hard-drive and remains after restarting
Fawkes or the whole system. Thus the robot memory enables a robot to
have a long time memory. It is possible to mark documents that should
not be stored persistently, by adding a expiration time or a key-value
pair describing that this document should be removed during a restart.

\subsection{Human Interface and Visualization:}
There are multiple possibilities to manually interface the robot
memory during the development. On the one hand, it is possible to
monitor and modify the content of the robot memory by using MongoDB
tools. There are the \texttt{mongo} command line program provided by
MongoDB and GUI based programs, such as
\emph{Robomongo}\footnote{\url{https://robomongo.org/}}, which
provides a table like view on collections and allows to perform
modifications without being familiar to the MongoDB syntax. This
leads to simple and efficient monitoring during the development.
On the other hand, the robot memory can be
accessed over blackboard interface messages, which can be sent over a
browser using the \texttt{webview} plugin. Thus it is possible to use
robot memory features, such as computables. To support debugging, the
robot memory logs operations, computable calls, and trigger
activations when specified in the configuration. It is possible to
visualize spatio-temporal data in the robot memory. For example, the
computation times in \reffig{fig:eval-durations-2} were inserted as
documents in the robot memory and plotted using the
\texttt{matplotlib} and \texttt{pymongo} libraries for Python.
